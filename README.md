# FuzzYourYelon
Advanced URL Fuzzer made in java. It allows the user to scan a website, get all links on it and then scan those links until it can find no more. This allows to understand the folder structure of a website and, who knows, some nice stuff ;).
I am not responsible for the use (or misuse) of this tool, I just did it for fun.

# Future plans
- [x] Scan hypertext documents.
- [x] Save directories.
- [ ] Save files.
- [ ] Add some kind of progress bar.
- [ ] Brute force url .
- [ ] Graphical user interface.
